# Deep-Learning

This repository contains my personal notes and summaries from many online papers. I've enjoyed every little bit of 
the course.

Repo contains six subrepo which code from scratch. The five subrepo titles are:
1. Artificial neural networks (ANN)
2. Deep neural network (DNN)
3. Convolutional neural network (ConvNets or CNNs)
4. self-organizing map (SOM)
5. Boltzmann machines
6. seq2seq Autoencoder

##### python libraries used ######
Tensorflow, 
PyTorch, 
Fastai, 
Keras,
numpy,
matplotlib,
seaborn
